# Heterogeneous Inference Systems in vLLM

This document explores heterogeneous inference architectures where prefill and decode phases run on different types of accelerators optimized for their respective workload characteristics.

## Overview

Heterogeneous inference systems represent the next evolution of disaggregated serving, leveraging the fundamental compute vs memory-bound nature of transformer inference phases:

- **Prefill Phase**: Compute-intensive, highly parallelizable
- **Decode Phase**: Memory-bandwidth bound, latency-sensitive

## Computational Characteristics

### Prefill Phase: Compute-Intensive

```python
# Prefill processes ALL input tokens simultaneously
Input: "Translate to French: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
Tokens: [T1, T2, T3, ..., T16]  # All 16 tokens processed at once

# Attention computation: O(n²) where n = input length  
for layer in model.layers:
    # Each token attends to ALL previous tokens
    attention_matrix = Q @ K.T  # Shape: [16, 16] - quadratic complexity!
    output = attention_matrix @ V
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Matrix Operations**: Large dense matrix multiplications
- **Parallelizable**: All tokens computed simultaneously  
- **GPU Utilization**: High - many arithmetic operations
- **Throughput Bound**: Limited by FLOPs capacity

### Decode Phase: Memory-Bound

```python
# Decode processes ONE token at a time
Current_token: "Le" (first generated token)
KV_cache: [cached_keys, cached_values] from prefill

# Attention: O(n) where n = sequence length so far
for layer in model.layers:
    # New token only attends to cached keys/values
    new_q = compute_query(current_token)      # Small: [1, hidden_size]
    attention = new_q @ cached_keys.T         # [1, seq_len] - linear!
    output = attention @ cached_values
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Small Compute**: Single token processing per step
- **Large Memory Access**: Reading entire KV cache history
- **Sequential Processing**: One token at a time
- **Bandwidth Bound**: Limited by memory throughput

## Accelerator Requirements Analysis

### Prefill-Optimized Accelerators

```python
prefill_accelerator_requirements = {
    "compute_throughput": "Very High",      # Dense matrix multiplications
    "memory_bandwidth": "Medium",           # Sequential writes to KV cache  
    "memory_capacity": "Medium",            # Temporary activations only
    "parallel_efficiency": "Critical",      # Batch processing advantage
    "cost_per_FLOP": "Competitive"         # Compute-intensive workload
}
```

**Best Options:**

    "memory_capacity": "Very High",        # Store KV cache for many sequences
    "low_latency": "Critical",             # Single-token responsiveness
    "cost_per_GB": "Competitive"          # Memory-intensive workload
}
```

**Best Options:**
- **High-Memory CPUs**: DDR5/HBM with large capacity

## Resource Usage Comparison

### Compute (FLOPs) Analysis

```
Prefill (input_len=512):
- Attention: 512² = 262K operations per layer
- Feed-forward: 512 × 4 × hidden_size operations  
- Total: ~100x more compute than single decode step

Decode (single token):
- Attention: 512 × 1 = 512 operations per layer
- Feed-forward: 1 × 4 × hidden_size operations
- Total: Minimal compute per step
```

### Memory Usage Analysis

```
Prefill Memory Requirements:
✓ Input embeddings: batch_size × input_len × hidden_size
✓ Activations: Large intermediate tensors during computation
✓ KV cache generation: Writing new cache entries  
✗ No existing KV cache to read (first time)

Decode Memory Requirements:
✗ Input embeddings: batch_size × 1 × hidden_size (minimal)
✗ Activations: Small intermediate tensors
✓ KV cache access: Reading ENTIRE cached history
✓ KV cache updates: Appending new cache entries
```

## Conclusion

Heterogeneous inference systems represent a paradigm shift in LLM serving, moving from "one-size-fits-all" hardware to specialized accelerators matched to workload characteristics. The fundamental compute/memory dichotomy of transformer inference makes this approach particularly compelling, with potential for:

- **60%+ cost reduction** compared to homogeneous setups
- **Better resource utilization** through workload matching
- **Improved performance predictability** via specialized optimization
- **Greater deployment flexibility** across diverse hardware ecosystems

As the ecosystem matures, we expect heterogeneous architectures to become the dominant approach for large-scale LLM serving, enabled by frameworks like vLLM that provide the necessary abstraction and optimization layers.
